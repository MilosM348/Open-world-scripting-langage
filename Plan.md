### 1. Define the Language's Abstract Syntax
- **Core Concepts**: Identify the core concepts and primitives of your language. These might include variables, constants, functions, and equations.
- **Syntax and Semantics**: Outline the syntax (how code is written) and semantics (what the code means) of your language. This will form the basis of your language specification.

### 2. Integrate Physical Equations
- **Equation Representation**: Determine how to represent physical equations in your language. This could involve creating special syntax or libraries for common equations.
- **Navier-Stokes and Beyond**: Build on your work with the Navier-Stokes equations, ensuring you have robust support for simulating fluid dynamics and other complex physical phenomena.

### 3. Implementing Fractals
- **Fractal Functions**: Develop functions or libraries to generate and manipulate fractals. You can start with simple fractal equations and gradually introduce more complex ones.
- **Link to Core Language**: Ensure that fractals integrate seamlessly with the rest of the language. They should be easy to use within scripts and interact naturally with other components.

### 4. Modifiable Language Core
- **Flexible Core**: Design the core of your language to be modifiable. This might involve creating a plugin system or allowing scripts to extend core functionality dynamically.
- **Version Control**: Implement version control for the language core, allowing users to update and customize it without breaking existing scripts.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- **Prototype and Test**: Build a prototype of your language and test it with various scenarios, including open-world game scripts and complex physical simulations.
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather feedback from users and iterate on the design and implementation.

### 6. Documentation and Examples
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Create detailed documentation, including a language specification, tutorials, and examples.
- **Sample Projects**: Develop sample projects demonstrating the language's capabilities, from simple scripts to complex simulations.
